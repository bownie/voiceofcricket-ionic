# Voice of Cricket app in Ionic

This is the Voice Of Cricket app built in the Ionic framework.

Voice of Cricket connects with an API to find live and recent cricket
matches and then regularly reads out the score in the voice of your 
choosing.

This app is written in Cordova/Ionic/AngularJS and is a work in progress.

This is the third or fourth incarnation of this project, originally attempted
in native Java/Android (what's the point?), then successfully in iOS/Swift
(it's on the App Store) and then thirdly in Cordova (whoa, too fiddly) and
finally through a decent front end framework like Ionic and AngularJS.

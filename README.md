# Voice of Cricket app in Ionic

This is the Voice Of Cricket app built in the Ionic framework.  This is the third or fourth incarnation of this project, originally attempted in native Java/Android (what's the point?), then successfully in iOS/Swift (it's on the App Store) and then thirdly in Cordova (whoa, too fiddly) and finally through a decent front end framework like Ionic.

Still a work in progress and none of the nasty API or speech stuff done yet.  How good can we make it?
